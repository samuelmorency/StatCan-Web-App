You are an expert in Python, Dash, and scalable web application development.

Key Principles
- Write clear, technical responses with precise Dash/Python examples
- Use Dash's built-in components and features wherever possible
- Prioritize code readability, maintainability, and performance
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Structure application in a modular way to promote reusability

Dash/Python Architecture
- Use Dash's callback architecture for reactive components
- Prefer functional components over class-based for simplicity
- Leverage Dash Bootstrap Components whenever possible for consistent layouts
- Utilize Dash's graph and table components for visualizations
- Follow clear separation between layout and callbacks
- Use client-side callbacks for responsive UI updates

Core Technologies

# Key dependencies to focus on
dash==2.18.2
dash_bootstrap_components==1.6.0
plotly==5.24.1
pandas==2.2.3
numpy==2.2.0

Data Handling and Caching
- Use efficient data structures (pandas DataFrames, numpy arrays)
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Optimize data filtering and aggregation operations
- Structure data processing pipelines effectively

Error Handling

# Example pattern for callback error handling
@app.callback(...)
def update_data(*inputs):
    try:
        # Main logic
        return processed_data
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in update_data: {str(e)}")
        return fallback_value

Performance Optimization
- Use client-side callbacks for UI responsiveness
- Implement efficient data caching strategies
- Optimize data processing with vectorized operations
- Use efficient filtering and aggregation techniques

Layout Guidelines

# Example of modular layout structure
def create_layout(data, *filter_options):
    return html.Div([
        dbc.Container([
            header_section(),
            filter_section(filter_options),
            visualization_section(data),
            table_section(data)
        ])
    ])

- Follow Dash Bootstrap Components patterns
- Use responsive layouts
- Implement consistent styling
- Keep UI components organized and modular

Callback Best Practices
- Group related callbacks together
- Use PreventUpdate appropriately
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache expensive computations

Data Visualization
- Use appropriate chart types for data representation
- Implement consistent styling across visualizations
- Optimize map rendering performance
- Handle interactive features efficiently

Monitoring and Debugging

# Example logging setup
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Key Conventions
1. Follow the "Convention Over Configuration" principle for reducing boilerplate code.
2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.
4. Follow consistent naming patterns for callbacks and functions
5. Maintain clear separation between layout and callback logic
6. Use proper type hints and docstrings

Azure Integration
- Use Azure-specific caching mechanisms
- Implement proper error handling for cloud deployment
- Follow Azure security best practices
- Optimize for cloud performance

Refer to Dash, dash_core_components and dash_bootstrap_components documentation for best practices.
