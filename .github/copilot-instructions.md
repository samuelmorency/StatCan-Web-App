When working with my InfoZone STEM/BHASE Graduate Dashboard codebase, please:

1. CONTEXT AWARENESS:
   - Always consult the README.md file first to understand the application's architecture
   - Reference the multi-layer data management architecture, processing pipeline, visualization system, cross-filtering implementation, map management subsystem, and performance optimization strategies documented there
   - Use this understanding as baseline knowledge for all tasks

2. TECHNICAL ACCURACY:
   - Ensure all recommendations align with the established patterns in the codebase
   - Respect the cross-filtering data flow when suggesting changes
   - Maintain consistency with existing performance optimization techniques
   - Preserve the modular architecture described in the documentation

3. DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE:
   - After suggesting significant code changes, provide corresponding updates to README.md
   - When adding new components, include documentation in the appropriate section of README.md
   - If modifying core architecture components, update the relevant architectural diagrams or flow descriptions
   - Document any performance optimizations with expected impacts

4. DOCUMENTATION FORMAT:
   - Maintain the existing hierarchical structure of README.md
   - Use bold for system component names
   - Include code snippets for technical concepts
   - Preserve the detailed cross-filtering flow descriptions

5. UPDATE TRACKING:
   - When providing README.md updates, format them as:
     ```
     # README.md Updates
     
     ## [Section Name]
     - [New/Modified] [Component/Feature]: [Brief description]
     - [Description of changes or additions to the documentation]
     
     ### Updated Text:
     ```[markdown]
     [Exact text to be added or modified in the README]
     ```
     ```

By following these instructions, you'll help ensure I maintain comprehensive documentation while implementing changes to my InfoZone Dashboard application.
